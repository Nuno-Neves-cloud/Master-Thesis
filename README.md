# Master-Thesis

The study aims the development of augmented reality tools to aid the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease research by exploring the differences in cortical thickness of distinct cohort subjects (cognitively normal, significant memory concern, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimerâ€™s Disease) using the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The MRIâ€™s from the database were processed with FreeSurfer, which generated cortical thickness measures for different brain regions.

The results were represented in a 3D brain model as a gradient of colors, with the colors being proportional to the loss of cortical thickness registered for each brain region. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the technology, the results were compared to reference studies in alzheimerâ€™s disease research. This demonstrates that the methods used in this dissertation are efficient and represent an alternative perspective for alzheimerâ€™s disease research.
